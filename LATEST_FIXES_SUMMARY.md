# Latest Portfolio Fixes - June 2025

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Mobile Contact Section Layout Fix
**Issue**: Content was getting cut off after "Let's discuss internship opportunity" text on mobile devices.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Enhanced Mobile CSS**: Completely rewrote mobile contact section styles with better spacing and typography
- **Responsive Text Sizing**: Implemented progressive text sizing for different screen sizes (768px, 480px, 320px)
- **Improved Layout**: Fixed contact methods display to use proper flexbox alignment instead of centering
- **Better Padding**: Adjusted padding and margins for optimal mobile viewing
- **Overflow Prevention**: Added word-wrap and overflow-wrap to prevent text cutoff

**Key CSS Changes**:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .contact-card h3 {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
        line-height: 1.3;
    }
    .contact-method {
        display: flex;
        gap: 1rem;
        align-items: flex-start;
        text-align: left;
    }
}
```

### 2. Automatic Dark/Light Mode Detection
**Feature**: Implemented system preference-based theme switching that automatically adapts to user's OS settings.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **CSS Variables**: Added comprehensive dark mode color variables using `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
- **Smooth Transitions**: All elements now transition smoothly between light and dark modes
- **JavaScript Detection**: Added automatic theme detection and optimization
- **Theme Persistence**: System tracks and responds to theme changes in real-time

**Key Features**:
- **Automatic Detection**: Uses `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` 
- **Smooth Transitions**: All UI elements transition smoothly between themes
- **Performance Optimized**: Dark mode reduces floating shape opacity for better visibility
- **Real-time Updates**: Responds instantly when user changes system theme

**Dark Mode Color Scheme**:
- Background: `#1a202c` → `#2d3748` → `#4a5568` (gradient)
- Text: `#f7fafc` (primary), `#cbd5e0` (secondary)
- Cards: `#2d3748` background with enhanced shadows
